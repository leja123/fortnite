    <h3>About Fortnite</h3>
    <p>Fortnite is an online game and the point of it, is to kill everyone in the battle - so you're the only one left and you win (make Victory Royale).</p>
    <h3>The battle</h3>	
    <p>Friends can join your party and you can play together. The game starts on the spawn island where you wait dor everyone to join the game and then the battle bus takes you across the island and you drop wherever you want. Then you have to find some weapons and attack other players. The storm appears too and there is a safe circle where you need to go if you want to survive. The circle is getting smaller and the point of it is to put all players on the same place so they're on one place. At the end the circle becomes so small and only a few players are left. The battle on average lasts for about 20 minutes and is depending on how fast you kill other players. </p>
    <h3>Items</h3>
    <p>It's possible to play with free pass or you can buy battle pass. The advantage of battle pass is that you get more items from it and most important - you get skins. You can buy some items in item shop which changes it's items almost everyday. To buy something you need V-bucks which you get in free/battle pass but you can buy it with real money as well. If you don't have a skin then you're default and usually people see defauslts as noobs and make fun of them.</p>
    <h3>Game modes</h3>
    <p>Currently, Fortnite is distributed as three different game modes, using the same engine and has similar graphics, art assets, and game mechanics.<br>
	<br><b>Save the World</b> is designed as player-versus-environment game, with four players cooperating towards a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like "husks". The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that help to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.<br>
	<b>Fortnite Battle Royale</b> is a player-versus-player battle royale game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players airdrop from a "Battle Bus" that crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and attack other players, eliminating them. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming storm; players outside that safe area take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.<br>
	<b>Fortnite Creative</b> is a sandbox game mode where players are given complete freedom to create anything they want on an island, such as battle arenas, race courses, platforming challenges and more. Epic Games reviews some of the most popular creations from Creative and rotate these into the Battle Royale map in an area called "The Block".[1] Featured creations are also shown in the "Creative Hub."</p>
